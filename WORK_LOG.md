| September 1 | 6-6:30pm  |                                                                                               Wasn't able to get that much done, but essentially the puzzle check and also the simplest possible solution to like the most basic Moksha Patam puzzles. |
| September 1 |  ??-??pm  | Unsure of the exact time since I wasn't fully focusing on CS and was instead working on it in chunks while doing something else, but wanted to separate it from future work and I improved the basic method as well as the check for solvable puzzles. |
